# CSE102_Term_Project
First term project as a student of CSE.

Boss Fight with Gunman-
The name sucks, I know. I just named it on the spot so that's that.
It is a very simple, like, too simple game where the player will control a gunman. Some enemies will appear in front of you, and you'll shoot 'em up.
That's it.

The project is written in C language. It uses iGraphics provided by our teachers.
